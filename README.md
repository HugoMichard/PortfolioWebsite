# Portfolio Website

## Project

This repository contains my personal portfolio website.

The challenge was to build this without using any frameworks, libraries or compilation. This website was built using exclusively HTML, CSS and Javascript. All code is ran and interpreted directly by the browser.

## Running locally

To run the website locally, you only need to download this repository and to open up `home.html` in your browser. That's it !

Currently mobile devices are not supported.

## Deployment

Deployment and hosting of my portfolio website is done with github pages. Hence, the website is accessible at https://hugomichard.github.io/PortfolioWebsite/home
